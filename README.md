ToDo MVC

Things to do:

- CSS styling for box shadow for 'footer' is 'cludged' and disappears at times. Needs more work.
- Add Bold styling to active routing link

Problems with Framework encountered :

- Checkbox component does not suspend events (eg checkbox.suspendEvents()). Events are still picked up by controllers.

- View jumps to top of screen when higher than screen and store.sync() is called. I think i have a 'patch' for that in
 on of my other applications and will research that.
